# Instructions:
# You are given a singly linked list that contains integer values, 
# where some of these values may be duplicated.

# Your task is to implement a method called remove_duplicates() within 
# the LinkedList class that removes all duplicate values from the list.

# Your method should not create a new list, but rather modify the existing 
# list in-place, preserving the relative order of the nodes.

# You can implement the remove_duplicates() method in two different ways:


# Using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n), 
# where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
# You are allowed to use the provided Set data structure in your implementation.

# Without using a Set - 
# This approach will have a time complexity of O(n^2), 
# where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
# You are not allowed to use any additional data structures for this implementation.


# Here is the method signature you need to implement:

# def remove_duplicates(self):


# Example:

# Input:

# LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5

# Output:

# LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
def remove_duplicates(self):
    values = set()
    previous = None
    temp = self.head
    while temp:
        if temp.value in values:
            previous.next = temp.next
            self.length -= 1
        else:
            values.add(temp.value)
            previous = temp
        temp = temp.next
